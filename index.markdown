    <p class="justified">Working as a member of the core subscription team, Sergejs took part in building the second version of an existing product that manages users Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu subscriptions. The newer version is built from the multiple independent components that can scale separately adapting to increasing users traffic. The product is also designed to be robust following principles of messaging and event-driven architecture. Thus having message delivery guarantees and the ability to consume messages eventually. The work anticipated a better subscriptions data model building and required on demand and full sweep data migration implementation. Development and going live happened gradually changing each subscription model at the time and then migrating each provider one by one. That helped to mitigate risks, i.e., initially releasing redesigned third-party subscriptions, then work was followed by in-app purchased subscriptions re-design and so on. The system was developed following functional programming ideology, and required a DevOps skillset.</p>
